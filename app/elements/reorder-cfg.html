        There are two ways to use this option (assuming 'delay 10ms' in the options list).

        <pre>reorder 25% 50% gap 5</pre>

        In this first example, the first 4 (gap - 1) packets are delayed by 10ms
        and subsequent packets are sent immediately with a probability of 0.25
        (with correlation of 50%) or delayed with a probability of 0.75. After a
        packet is reordered, the process restarts i.e. the next 4 packets are
        delayed and subsequent packets are sent immediately or delayed based on
        reordering probability. To cause a repeatable pattern where every 5th
        packet is reordered reliably, a reorder probability of 100% can be used.

        <pre>reorder 25% 50%</pre>

        In this second example 25% of packets are sent immediately (with
        correlation of 50%) while the others are delayed by 10 ms.
